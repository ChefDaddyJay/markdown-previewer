Markdown formatted input will be previewed in the browser as HTML

## freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification Project 2

This is a standalone application inspired by the second certificaton project for the Front End Development Libraries course at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). When the application loads, the user is presented with a text area, containing example Markdown text and another area showing a preview of the HTML equivalent of the example text. As the user changes the text in the input area, the preview changes to represent the new input.
